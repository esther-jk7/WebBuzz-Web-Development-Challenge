# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chakridhar2555/Chakridhar2555-WebBuzz-Web-Development-Challenge.git
   cd Chakridhar2555-WebBuzz-Web-Development-Challenge
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Vite**
   If Vite is not already installed in your project, run:
   ```bash
   npm install vite --save-dev
   ```
   Or, if you're using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn add vite --dev
   ```

4. **Verify vite.config.js**
   Ensure that your `vite.config.js` file is correctly set up. It should look something like this:
   ```javascript
   import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

   export default defineConfig({
     // your configuration here
   });
   ```

5. **Delete Node Modules and Reinstall**
   If Vite is already in your `package.json`, delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), then reinstall:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```
   Or for Yarn:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock
   yarn install
   ```

6. **Check Node Version**
   Ensure you're using a compatible version of Node.js (version 12 or later). You can check your version with:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

7. **Clear Cache**
   Sometimes caching issues can cause problems. Clear the npm cache:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

8. **Run the Development Server**
   After performing these steps, start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Or:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```
